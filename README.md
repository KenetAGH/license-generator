I thought a phonetic spelling would be easy to remember. My apologies to
anyone named Jennifer.

## Supported license arguments:

* bsd: [The BSD License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)

### Please add some!

There are a lot. See <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical>.

1. Fork the project
2. Create a branch for your new license
3. Add it. Just look at the others for examples. Don't forget the tests!
4. Add your new license argument to the README.
5. Leave the version number alone. I'll handle that.
6. Push it. Send a pull request.
7. I will pull it and add you to the credits for fame and glory.
8. Pat yourself on the back.
